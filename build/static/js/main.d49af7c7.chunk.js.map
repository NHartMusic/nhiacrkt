There's a reason that this album is topping just about\n                            everyone's list, and it's not just a bandwagon effect. If I'm being completely honest, I've\n                            never considered myself a diehard fan of Apple's work, and I can't really remember putting\n                            her in a top 10 of any year-end list that I've done in the past - and I've been making lists\n                            like these since I was in middle school. Listening to the rest of her work in retrospect,\n                            I can say that I definitely find myself more impressed with it now - the songwriting craft,\n                            the musical abilities, her unique voice and lyrics are all things that I appreciate now as an\n                            adult who studied music theory and performance in college, but there's also something about\n                            her work that is just so obtuse and not \"kid-friendly\", it's really not a wonder that in\n                            my younger years listening to exclusively garage rock and J Dilla that I didn't grasp the full\n                            depth and emotional power of her songwriting.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            As someone who is admittedly a fairly recent convert of hers, it's hard to point out exactly\n                            what part of this album made me such a believer. Is it the way she stretches her vocal abilities\n                            to new heights? Is it the rolling, tumbling tUnE-yArDs-esque percussion (which much of was apparently\n                            recorded on a lot of non-percussion-instrument surfaces including banging on the walls of her house)?\n                            Is it the powerful lyrical subject matter dealing with themes of self-empowerment and subjegation from\n                            a capitalist patriarchical society? Yes. It is those things.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            But most of all, it's the fact that even though this album deals with some of the depths of human depravity,\n                            it bubbles with the electric joy of a child discovering music for the first time. There are some lyrical and\n                            musical connections to her previous work, and I guess you could construe <i>some</i> influences from specific\n                            genres of music, but overall, this sounds like creation of art in it's purest form - there hasn't been anything\n                            else this year that sounded so unique and so entirely distinct from any other music in existence.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel2'} onChange={handleChange('panel2')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>2.

They are alchemists. To describe their music as \"sample-based\"\n                            or \"mashups\" is to imply that they are something akin to Girl Talk, or even Madlib, when in\n                            truth, their albums feel closer to a Jackson Pollock painting - a mess of colors that somehow\n                            form an otherworldly singular piece of art, the likes of which no other producers in existence\n                            are capable of creating.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            I'm still in disbelief that these guys (the two that are left of the original 6-piece collective)\n                            came back from a 16-year radio silence with <i>Wildflower</i> 4 years ago, and I thought that maybe\n                            that would be a coda of sorts, the last we would ever hear from them, at least for another decade or\n                            so. And then, a painfully slow and mysterious rollout of new material began all the way back in February,\n                            starting with the release of the title track of this album, featuring Dev Hynes, and a bizarre publicity stunt involving&nbsp;\n                            <a target='_none' href='https://www.instagram.com/p/B8vPg7EHJu5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link'>streaming of music from the Capitol Records tower</a>.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            In the time since they started rolling out the album, and its release earlier this month, the world has changed\n                            more than anyone could have imagined it would be able to in the span of 10 months. And considering the amount of\n                            sample clearance and coordination between guest stars a project like this takes, there's no way that most or all of\n                            this music wasn't recorded well before the pandemic kicked into high gear. Yet it somehow feels timelier than\n                            the gimmicky nature of album covers from the likes of&nbsp;<a target='_none' href='https://images.genius.com/fd3a2acc2a6cfc5a37dd3e57ffc07c7e.1000x1000x1.jpg'>DaBaby</a>\n                            &nbsp;or album titles from&nbsp;<a target='_none' href='https://images.genius.com/83c9845de35bc9ac0b004f95a6680fee.1000x1000x1.jpg'>Tobe Nwigwe</a>, with it's overarching\n                            theme of cosmic love transcending the barriers that death instills upon us mortals. The Avalanches flip samples that\n                            on paper shouldn't work at all, they bring back seemingly has-been artists like Perry Ferrell and Rivers Cuomo for songs that\n                            feel futuristic, and they have the best transitions between songs of any producers working right now. This project, as is\n                            all their work, is a testament to the past, present and future of not just music, but human connection.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel3'} onChange={handleChange('panel3')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>3.

Lyrically speaking, aesthetically speaking, not to mention all of Killer Mike's\n                            advocacy work and public appearances this year - no album in any genre seemed to put such a fine point\n                            on all of the ugly truths of the world that were brought to the surface by 2020. Not that the Grammy's\n                            matter at all, but the fact that they chose to snub THIS album in THIS year is absolutely inexplicable\n                            to me. This is the best hip hop project of 2020, the best album of RTJ's career, and the frontrunner for\n                            the album we're shooting into space to tell the aliens exactly how this dumpster fire of a year affected\n                            humanity.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel4'} onChange={handleChange('panel4')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>4.

I was especially skeptical of this plan coming from the Dirty Projectors,\n                        considering Dave Longstreth fired (and/or divorced) everyone from the band a few years ago, and reduced it to\n                        a solo project, before building it up again with a new lineup. I saw the DPs a couple times in 2018 with the\n                        new female vocalists doing a great job of performing songs written for their predecessors, but they still\n                        didn't feel quite as distinct as Deradoorian or Amber's unique styles from their earlier work.\n                    </ParagraphRegular>\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            So what a pleasant surprise it was to see that this series of EPs (now available to stream as one continuous\n                       project) is the best stuff Longstreth has put out since <i>Swing Lo Magellan</i> back in 2012.

True to\n                        it's name, which means 'ashes' in Jaar's mother tongue of Spanish, the album feels sparse,\n                        minimal, as if it was crafted from flames and scorched in the process. It's Jaar's most distinct\n                        work yet - which is no small feat for a producer this inventive and influential on the current\n                        experimental music scene. In terms of how 'out there' it gets on a sonic level,\n                        <i>Cenizas</i> sits somewhere between the ambient freakout of <i>Telas</i> which he released in July,\n                        and the industrial dance grooves of <i>2017 - 2019</i>, which he released under his Against All Logic\n                        moniker in February. Yes, that's correct, Jaar dropped 3 albums this year, 4 if you include the\n                        live album from his recently revived Darkside project. All of these albums appeared seemingly out\n                        of nowhere with little to no promotional build up, and all of them show an artist in peak form,\n                        trapped in an unstoppable momentum with seemingly no intention of slowing down any time soon.\n                    </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel6'} onChange={handleChange('panel6')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>6.

This is one of those albums that you can never really replicate what it was like to listen to\n                            the first time - it's like watching a movie with twists and turns that come out of nowhere and add\n                            new context to the rest of the narrative with each new plot development.\n                    </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel7'} onChange={handleChange('panel7')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>7.

Dan Snaith's seventh album under his Caribou moniker\n                        pivots between styles on a dime and throws samples out of nowhere that inexplicably stick the\n                        landing every time. Inspired by how death and divorce can shake up your life in unexpected ways,\n                        this is some of the most emotional music Snaith has ever released, and it ranks among his best.\n                        This was the first great album of the year, and I still find myself replaying it regularly.\n                    </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel8'} onChange={handleChange('panel8')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>8.

It may\n                            be borderline unlistenable to casual fans of shiny, polished pop music, but the hooks and melodies\n                            are undeniable even to those who hate the metallic clanging and distorted synths. This is probably\n                            the best and least cringey \"quarantine\" inspired album to come out of this year, and I found it\n                            infinitely more interesting than just about anything Charli has released yet.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel9'} onChange={handleChange('panel9')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>9.

This album was surprise released at the beginning of the BLM protests this summer,\n                        and tracks like <i>Scottie Beam</i> are eerily prescient in their timing.

In 2020 Jaar basically accomplished the opposite of what\n                            Bruce Banner and The Hulk did in Avengers Endgame; instead of merging his two\n                            musical personas, he definitively split them up, and by doing so, allowed them\n                            room to breathe. For the artistic crew, we still have his ambient, jazz inspired\n                            work under his own name, but for the fans that fell in love with Jaar for his\n                            peerless Boiler Room set, AAL seems like it's here to stay.

Instead of trying to piece together\n                            another concept album, Albarn spent 2020 releasing individual tracks with some of the wackiest\n                            collaborations in the projects entire run, complete with animated music videos for each one,\n                            and interactive online material for fans to play around with. Released from the confines of\n                            thematic consistency, this is Albarn in full on mad scientist mode, sticking Elton John and\n                            6LACK on the same song, having Goldlink rap over instrumentation from Unknown Mortal Orchestra -\n                            it's just fucking bonkers through and through. Although I wish some artists were utilized better\n                            (some actual lead vocals from St. Vincent would have been cool), standouts like EARTHGANG's 7-minute\n                            <i>Opium</i> and Peter Hook's guitar playing on <i>Aries</i> are some of the best work ever produced\n                            under the Gorillaz moniker.

Whether he continues\n                            down this lane of sci-fi yacht rock or harkens back to his earlier, trippier work remains to be seen,\n                            but this album further solidifies his standing as one of the controlling forces of modern rock and roll.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel29'} onChange={handleChange('panel29')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>29.

Black Thought is top 5 dead or alive,\n                            and I will always look forward to any and every release he graces us with.\n                    </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel34'} onChange={handleChange('panel34')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>34.LA Priest - Gene  </SubTitle>\n                </AccordionSummary>\n                <AccordionDetails>\n                    <TextWrapperLeft>\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            I was super surprised and excited to see Sam Dust's bizarro funk project pop up again this year.\n                            This dude has been part of some of the most interesting and off-the-wall pop music in the past decade\n                            and a half, including the short lived band Late of the Pier, and the collaborative album he made\n                            with Connan Mockasin under the name Soft Hair. Out of all his projects though, LA Priest was always\n                            my favorite, and I was glad to learn that it wasn't just a one-off. Although this album isn't as\n                            surprising or wide-ranging as his debut <i>Inji</i>, the genre hopping is much smoother here,\n                            there's a more consistent aesthetic and vibe, and the production and engineering is more refined.\n                            Although I would rather not wait another 4-5 years for more work from Mr. Dust, as long as it's this\n                            smooth, I can be patient.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel35'} onChange={handleChange('panel35')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>35.

With the exception of\n                            the intro to J Dilla's <i>The Shining</i> (which is still one of the funniest album intros ever recorded),\n                            Busta just never really did it for me.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            Maybe it's because I've grown more interested in experimental hip hop as I've gotten older and I can appreciate\n                            his influence more, or maybe it's just the chaotic moment we find ourselves in, but this album is honestly one\n                            of the more fitting hip hop releases for 2020. It's just absolute fucking madness through and through, and the\n                            Chris Rock interludes help remove any sense of self seriousness that could have killed the bonkers vibe here. While I\n                            could do without the Louis Farrakhan shit (ya know, the guy who said that \"Hitler was a very great man\"), I was pleasantly\n                            surprised to see just how well Busta's flow gelled with contemporary artists like Anderson .Paak and Kendrick Lamar.\n                            Not to mention, the fact that he got Mariah Carrey to spit <i>that</i> fast on her feature is an accomplishment all\n                            on its own.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel36'} onChange={handleChange('panel36')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>36.

I'm more of a fan of Thee Oh Sees\n                            when they adhere closer to garage psych stuff rather than thrash metal influences, so the first couple tracks here took\n                            a while to sink their teeth in to me.. But man. Does this album fucking rip. The spooky keyboard on \"Said The Shovel\"? Sublime.\n                            That bassline on \"If I Had My Way\"? Probably the best surf rock riff in the past decade. Of course, both of those songs\n                            got some cool reprises on <i>Panther Rotate</i>, Thee Oh Sees' final release of the year, but the originals are just classic\n                            Dwyer in their most pristine, unpolished form. It's honestly an intimidating task to try and keep up with all the albums\n                            this guy churns out, so if you have to only pick one that came out in 2020, this is the one.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel37'} onChange={handleChange('panel37')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>37.

This album isn't quite as extravagent or surprising as\n                            <i>Bromst</i>, and not nearly as thrilling as the\n                            <a target=\"_none\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dan-deacon/sets/wish-book-volume-1\">all-time greatest mashup project</a>\n                            that he dropped while I was in college, but it still ranks amongst his best work. Between the 4-part \"Arp\" suite and\n                            the epic \"Fell Into The Ocean\", this album really helped bring a cinematic, open world feel to the isolation\n                            I experienced early in quarantine, and I will forever be thankful to Mr. Deacon for that.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel38'} onChange={handleChange('panel38')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>38.

My homie Justin \"J Hawk\" Hawkins and\n                            his crew, the G.H.E.T.T.O Kids Music Group did a lot of the instrumentation on this album, and I'm super fucking\n                            proud of his work. This also just happens to be a super smooth, funk and energetic work that frankly sounded\n                            unlike any other hip hop released this year. It's the kind of music I wish Goldlink was still making, it's like\n                            BROCKHAMPTON if they actually got their hands on good quality therapy and antidepressants.

When they first came onto the scene, they generated more hype from being a sister act\n                            than they did for... actually writing good music. I'm always pretty lukewarm on country pop stuff, so maybe\n                            they were never really my kind of thing to begin with, but the production help from Rostam and a smidgeon of\n                            drums from my cuz Jim-E really brought this one up to another level in my book. \"3 AM\" is easily one of the\n                            best singles of the year, and \"Up From a Dream\" weirdly sounds like the sequel to Angel Olsen's \"What It Is\",\n                            the standout on <i>All Mirrors</i>, which was my #1 album of last year. I'm very curious to see where these\n                            ladies go in the future, including Danielle Haim's role in Paul Thomas Anderson's next film.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel40'} onChange={handleChange('panel40')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>40.

I found some of the song transitions and switches between genres (especially the first 3)\n                            a bit jarring on this album, but it's still really cool to see her play around with something that almost resembles pop\n                            music. While I still prefer Arca when she's just full out experimental and bonkers, some of the sweeter melodic moments\n                            here are just fucking gorgeous, and I'm really excited to see what the next step of her career looks like.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel41'} onChange={handleChange('panel41')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>41.

The guitar tone\n                            on the first two tracks alone is enough to get this a slot in the top 50. Some of the lyrics on tracks like\n                            \"Pink Elephant\" don't quite hold up under scrutiny, but the riffs are consistently peerless.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel42'} onChange={handleChange('panel42')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>42.

So perhaps the smartest\n                            decision on UR FUN is not the lovely retro album cover, or the incredibly timely song title of \"Don't Let Me\n                            Die in America\", no it's just the fact that Barnes decided to bring things back to basics with a simple (by\n                            of Montreal standards), straight forward synth pop album. There's nothing here as exciting as the Georgie Fruit\n                            run, but it absolutely lives up to the album title. This is one I would kill to see live once it's safe to do\n                            so again.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel46'} onChange={handleChange('panel46')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>46.

Please don't ever stop making records. The San Francisco-based experimental\n                            noise-pop-funk-whatever-genre-they're-playing-now outfit is one of the few bands that seems to never ever\n                            get stale. In fact, I don't think they could make boring music if they tried. There's some killer, crunchy,\n                            gnarly rhythmic stuff going on throughout this album, but honestly, the title track/lead single/album opener\n                            is the standout - it's one of their best songs they've ever released. They put out at least 2 other albums of\n                            far more experimental stuff this year that I haven't gotten around to yet, but that track alone is one of my\n                            top 5 songs of the year, and their entire career.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel47'} onChange={handleChange('panel47')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>47.

Part of me thinks\n                            he hates it and it's just a chore to him, and he couldn't make a 100% serious album even if he\n                            tried. But he doesn't try. And that's ok.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                        <ParagraphRegular>\n                            If you read any interviews with him about the making of this album, he will talk a lot about how\n                            the tragic death of his good friend Mac Miller had a big effect on everything here including the\n                            title. That certainly shines through in some parts - but overall this is a party record. And a great\n                            one too. The Louis Cole collaboration, aptly titled \"I Love Louis Cole\" is a clear standout, as\n                            are all of the singles and fantastic music videos that came along with this. Thundercat is probably\n                            the least serious \"serious\" musician recording today, and I love him for it.\n                        </ParagraphRegular>\n                    </TextWrapperLeft>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion square expanded={expanded === 'panel48'} onChange={handleChange('panel48')}>\n                <AccordionSummary>\n                    <SubTitle>48.

Honestly\n                            I really don't know what Aesop was going for. The vocals are harsh and frankly unlistenable in in-ear headphones,\n                            which I regretably use too often these days. Which is a fucking shame, considering that he's really at the top\n                            of his game lyrically and musically speaking. The production is absolutely phenomenal, and the loose spirtual concept that\n                            binds it all together really works for the most part. I really really want to love this album, and for the most part I do.\n                            I think Aesop Rock is one of the best rappers around, and he's proven himself to be a fantastic producer too. Just please for\n                            the love of god, get someone else to mix the vocals next time. Jesus fucking christ. This could have been a classic.
